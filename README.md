## F0-estimate and onset detect for singing ##
* the project aims to solve F0 estimate and onset detect using mfshs algorithm and CNN for singing.
* the Application scenario include solfege„ÄÅ Karaoke and  various Monophonic scenes

### include algorithm ###
1.	F0 estimate (similar to yin)
2.	sw alignment
3.	CNN for onset detect
4.	post process by combining the above algorithm

### requirement ###
* tensorflow
* numpy
* librosa

### run ###
```
python main.py
```

onset detection method cite this paper
